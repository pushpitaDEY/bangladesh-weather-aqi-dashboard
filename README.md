## 🌦️ Power BI Weather & AQI Dashboard — Bangladesh Cities

  This project showcases a real-time weather and air quality (AQI) dashboard built using Power BI and data from WeatherAPI.com. It provides live insights into temperature, humidity, wind speed, air quality, 
  and chances of rain for six major Bangladeshi cities over a 7-day period.

🔗 Guided by The Developer – YouTube Channel, extended with custom enhancements like AQI metrics, rain probability charts, and city-level interactivity.
